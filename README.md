# CSC 2310 Spring 2022 TN Tech Dashboard Project

**Iteration 2, Complete solution**

This is the final product of a full-development process which began near the beginning of the spring semester of 2022.
Other iterations included writing user stories, use-case diagrams, class diagrams relating to those user stories and use-case diagrams, 
an initial spike for the project to make sure the TN Tech webservice could be accessed, iteration 1, and finally iteration 2.
This program is meant to access the already-implemented webservice at Tech, which supplies all course information for a semester and subject you enter in.
The methods implemented then filter that data and return a new form of the data to the user in a more concise and readable way.

## Description of Directories

src/main contains all java class files needed for the program to work  
src/test contains a java test class named ServiceBridgeTest which contains tests for all implemented methods in the ServiceBridge class  
docs contains files generated by javadocs, mainly just comments about methods and how they work  
target contains the directories needed to build the project with the package command  
pom.xml contains code that allows maven to successfully build the project, may need to be configured for certain circumstances

## Compilation Instructions

mvn clean             (removes all files generated by the previous build command)  
mvn compile           (compiles all source files within the project)  
mvn package           (makes sure everything is compiled and runs user-created tests)  
mvn spring-boot:run   (starts up the webservice at localhost)  

Once the last command has been run, the service should be running at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can open the browser and type a method name that has been implemented in the ServiceBridge class after the last forward slash in the previous url,
then type '?' and the parameter names seperated by '&'. For example (http://localhost:8080/coursesbysubject?term=202210&subject=CSC).

## Development Instructions

git clone https://gitlab.csc.tntech.edu/csc2310-sp22-students/pgnicholso42/pgnicholso42-dashboard_2.git (clones the project from the repo).
If this does not work, try instead: git clone https://github.com/PrestonN44/Spring-2022-TNTech-Dashboard

After cloning, when you open up a class from the src directory you may receive a warning at the top right of IntelliJ recommending you set up
a project sdk. Click that and select a version of java 11 to develop the project with. This will ensure all methods and classes used work as intended.

More useful commands to use while developing:  
git add . (adds all files in the current directory to git, although the cloned files should already be added)  
git commit -m "Enter commit message here" (commits all changes up till now, so they can be pushed to the repo later)  
git push -u origin master (pushes all committed changes to the repo)
